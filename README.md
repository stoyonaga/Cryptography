# Cryptography

This repository contains programs which help encrypt and decrypt various ciphers which were discussed in LE/EECS 4161: Mathematics of Cryptography. 

While the [original repository](https://github.com/stoyonaga/EECS-Notes/tree/main/EECS%204161) with the helper programs for the assignments still remains accessible, these newer programs offer more functionalities in addition to support and scalability.

Please refer to the following table for the assignment programs which have been augmented.

Assignment ID | Program | Improvements
---|---|---
1 | caesar.py | **generate_english_frequency_analysis(ct: str)** allows you to graphically represent the frequency analysis of the ciphertext with relation to that of the English language.
2 | vigenere.py | Code Readability has been improved. Additionally, this program allows the student to view the differences between encrypting and decrypting from a formula versus the vigenere square.
3 | transposition.py | Code Readability has been improved. Each step of the encryption and or decryption has explicitly been programmed into separate functions.
4 | playfair.py | Code has been refactored and additional functions have been added to support the learning objectives of this assignment.
5 | homophonic.py |  Added encryption and decryption support.
6 | ADFGVX.py | Added encryption and decryption support.
7 | Vername (Two-Tape) Cipher | Added encryption and decryption support.

In the future, other ciphers which are not discussed in EECS 4161 may be added here (for fun!).
